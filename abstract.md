Computerized assessments are increasingly popular. They need to be optimized so that students spend as little time as possible in assessment and still receive an accurate evaluation. Such optimization is possible through learning analytics and computerized adaptive testing (CAT), in which the next question is chosen according to the previous responses of the examinee, thereby improving decision making in assessment. Using the data collected from former students, it is thus possible to uncover the latent ability or knowledge of the examinees by telling them what to do next. We will present several models of CAT together with their main characteristics. We will then compare these models empirically on real data. Finally, we will open up on the future of computerized assessments.
